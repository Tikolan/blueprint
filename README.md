# Blueprint Repository

This repository has been reorganized for better structure.

## File Locations

- **Blueprint bundles and WordPress uploads**: These files have been moved to the `dele` branch to keep the main branch clean.
- To access the archived files, switch to the `dele` branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout dele
  ```

## Branch Structure

- `main`: Clean branch for active development
- `dele`: Archive branch containing all blueprint bundle files and WordPress uploads
